# NFL Betting Market Project

This project analyzes inefficiencies in the NFL betting market using game data from every NFL game played since 1980. The work was originally completed in Python, but the original codebase is no longer available due to archival loss. The purpose of this analysis was to explore how specific betting lines have historically performed and identify where the betting market may show predictable patterns.
